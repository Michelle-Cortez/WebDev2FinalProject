Use what I've learned this semester and demonstrate a clear understanding to create a page that uses input to get zip code and farenheit or Celcius values and use in an API call that returns the current temp, current condidtions and city. page may only accept US zip codes Use API from openweathermap.org

  I will be demonstrating use of html, css, js, Arrays, Api call using axios, Vue, RegEx, bootstrap, source control through github.
